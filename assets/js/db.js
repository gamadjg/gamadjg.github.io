	bio: [
		"My interests lie within architecting and designing foundations for scaling solutions. Throughout 4 years of startup IT Operations consulting, my enthusiasm peaked when I would find myself picking up Python or PowerShell to automate a task. Realizing that a solid foundation and some creative organization went a very long way in reducing future issues for myself and everyone around me, I made the decision to expand my programming knowledge past scripting and into learning the ins and outs of full-stack software development. After a year of teaching myself via self paced online courses, I enrolled myself into a rigorous coding bootcamp to flesh out my knowledge and fill in any remaining gaps. ",
